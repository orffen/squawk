# Squawk!

Squawk! is a small utility originally created to generate valid transponder
codes for flight simulation flights that aren't ATC-controlled.

Additionally, it includes a top of descent calculator and it can pull METAR/TAF
information from the real world (your simulator's weather may differ).
